Hello kind reader. I guess it is tradition to introduce oneself as the first post on the blog. So here I go. My name is Yan Pujante. I am originally from France and currently living in the Silicon Valley close to San Francisco. I am a software engineer at heart and have been since I was 11 years old... a long time ago :). If you are interested to learn a lot more about me, you can always check my fairly complete <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/yan">profile</a> on LinkedIn.

<p>In this blog I am planning to write mainly about software, with an emphasis on sharing my experiences with the new technologies I am working with both at <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://www.pongasoft.com">pongasoft</a>. I hope you find it interesting. Don't hesitate to leave feedback!</p>


<h4>Update 2011/02/24</h4>
The blog used to be called 'The software cookbook' and part of the migration to
jekyll, it has been renamed 'Br0kenB1ts1.

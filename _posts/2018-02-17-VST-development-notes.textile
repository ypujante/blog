As I am learning about VST development I wanted to share my notes, first as a way to document my own understanding for the future and second as a way to help others following a similar path.

<div class="warning">This is currently a work in progress. This is not meant to be generic for all platforms and is only focusing on macOS.</div>

h2. Configuration

At the time of this writing (February 2018) I am using: 

* Hardware: MacBook Pro (Mid 2014) / 2.8Ghz Intel Core i7 / 16GB
* macOS High Sierra 10.13.3
* Xcode 9.2
* CLion 2017.3.3

h2. Notes

h3. Install

Version VST 3 / 368 (vstsdk368_08_11_2017_build_121) downloaded from "Steinberg":https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

After unpacking, run 

{% highlight text %}
./copy_vst2_to_vst3_sdk.sh
{% endhighlight %}

to make sure that we can build VST2 wrappers as well (VST3 is very poorly supported, ex: Maschine by Native Instruments or Reason by Properllerhead do not support it)

h3. Documentation

Documentation starts with <code>VST3_SDK/index.html</code> and is not really beginner friendly.

h3. Building the SDK

The section named _"How to use cmake for Building VST 3 Plug-in"_ is a bit confusing to me

* first of all, CMake is not used (directly) to build VST 3 plugins. CMake is used to generate a platform dependent project (ex: Xcode project for Mac, Visual Studio project for Windows or Makefiles). This project (hence the build framework associated with it) is then used to build the examples provided in the sdk as well as compile the SDK itself (multiple libraries) and some tools.
* second of all, this section has no explanation on how you build your OWN VST plugins.

I investigated 2 ways of building the SDK and examples: one with Xcode and one with CLion

h4. Building the SDK (with Xcode)

h5. Generate Xcode project

* Run <code>cmake-gui</code> (version 3.9.4 installed from "CMake download":https://cmake.org/download/) from anywhere.
* In the <code>Where is the source code:</code> field, point to the <code>VST3_SDK</code> folder.
* In the <code>Where to build the binaries:</code> field, point to any folder you want but since it will create a project whose purpose is to build the SDK I choose to put it at the same level as <code>VST3_SDK</code> and call it <code>build</code>.
* Click <code>Configure</code> (and approve creation of the output folder if it does not exist).
* Select <code>Xcode</code> for the _generator_ for this project.
* Once the configuration completes, the Name/Value section will have some default values. Check the <code>SMTG_CREATE_VST2_VERSION</code> option because we want to build VST2 plugins as well.
* Click <code>Generate</code>

h5. Build the again example

<div class="info">All this is relative to the <code>Where to build the binaries:</code> folder previously set (which in my case is <code><SDK_ROOT>/build</code>)</div>

* Under the output folder previously selected there is now a Xcode project called <code>vstsdk</code>. Double click to open in Xcode.
* In the <code>Scheme</code> selection dropdown (on the right of the buttons that look like play & stop), select <code>again / My Mac</code>
* Now select menu <code>Product/Build</code> to build <code>again</code> plugin
* The result of the build will be stored under <code>VST3/Debug/again.vst3</code>
* As a side effect of this build, some libraries were generated (under <code>lib/Debug</code>) and a validator tool (<code>bin/Debug/validator</code>)
* Run the validator tool:

{% highlight text %}
./bin/Debug/validator VST3/Debug/again.vst3
...
* Scanning classes...

  Factory Info:
	vendor = Steinberg Media Technologies
	url = http://www.steinberg.net
	email = mailto:info@steinberg.de

  Class Info 0:
	name = AGain VST3
	category = Audio Module Class
	cid = 84E8DE5F92554F5396FAE4133C935A18

  Class Info 1:
	name = AGain VST3Controller
	category = Component Controller Class
	cid = D39D5B65D7AF42FA843F4AC841EB04F0

  Class Info 2:
	name = AGain SideChain VST3
	category = Audio Module Class
	cid = 41347FD6FED64094AFBB12B7DBA1D441
...
-------------------------------------------------------------
Result: 78 tests passed, 0 tests failed
-------------------------------------------------------------
{% endhighlight %}

* Copy the plugin as a VST2 plugin for local testing
{% highlight text %}
cp -r VST3/Debug/again.vst3 ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST/again.vst
{% endhighlight %}

* Open a DAW application (Maschine in my example) and assign the plugin to a sound (the plugin is under <code>Steinberg Media Technologies</code>)

h4. Building the SDK (with CLion)

"Clion":https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/ can actually work directly with CMake thus making the process more straighforward and cleaner as you are only dealing with the original project. The drawback of using the previous approach (using CMake to generate an Xcode project) is that if you modify the Xcode project (for example add a resource to a plugin) it is not reflected in the CMake world. On the other end, CLion shows the original project and use CMake directly, so as a result if you add a resource to the project it will be added to the CMake world.

* Simply open the project with CLion (folder <code>VST3_SDK</code>)
* Then under the menu <code>Preferences / Build,Execution,Deployment / CMake</code> add the <code>CMake options</code>: 
{% highlight text %}
-DSMTG_CREATE_VST2_VERSION=ON
{% endhighlight %}
* Note that you can change the <code>Generation path:</code> so that it is outside the source folder (which I personally prefer)
* Select the <code>again | Debug</code> configuration (similar to Xcode scheme) and select the menu item <code>Run / Build</code>
* The outcome will be under <code>VST3</code> (relative to <code>Generation Path</code>)

Testing with <code>validator</code> and deploying to a DAW are the same as the Xcode section with the difference that there is no <code>Debug</code> subfolders.

h3. TO BE CONTINUED

Open questions:

* How to build your own plugin OUTSIDE the SDK. Ideally depending only on header files and libraries generated during the previous build
* How to build in Release mode

This post will be updated soon...
